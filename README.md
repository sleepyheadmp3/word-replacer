<h1>WordReplacer.java</h1>
<p>This was the final exam capstone project for COMSW3134 with Dr. Borowski at Columbia University.</p>
<p>WordReplacer.java is a  command line Java application that performs a global search and replace
on a text file using either a binary search tree, a red-black tree, or a hash map. The program works on whole words only; substrings of words are not considered separate words, and replacement rules cannot contain spaces or multiple words. No contradictory or duplicate rules will function either, but cycles may be present within the rules.</p>
<p>This program functions correctly in terms of replacing words in a file, but I was unfortunately unable to execute cycle compression before the assignment due date. The code includes an attempt at remedying cycles, but it is non-functional. Rip.</p>
